The reference PDA excitation times in 'validation_pda.dat' were generated with the following command:

promdens -np 1000 -w 0.14294844 -lch 2e-6 -f 100 -ps --random_seed 123456789 -n 1000 input_nai.dat

Combining FSSH trajectories started at given excitation times leads to a quantitative comparison with QD with explicit pulse, see 'pda_vs_qd.png'.
