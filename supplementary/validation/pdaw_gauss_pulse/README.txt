The reference PDAW weights in 'validation_pdaw.dat' were generated with the following command:

promdens -m pdaw -w 0.13520905 -f 20 -n 1000 input_nai.dat 

Applying the convolution and weights to FSSH trajectories leads to a quantitative comparison with QD with explicit pulse, see 'pdaw_vs_qd.png'.
